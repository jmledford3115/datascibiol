<title>GLOBAL CAPTURE PRODUCTION - GENERAL NOTES</title> 
<header1> <h3>GLOBAL CAPTURE PRODUCTION
  </h3></header1>
<body> <p> This dataset covers annual series of capture production from 1950. Capture fisheries refers to the hunting, collecting and gathering 
activities directed at removing or collecting live wild aquatic organisms. Data relate to nominal landings, converted into a live weight basis, 
of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic mammals, other aquatic animals, products (corals, pearls and sponges) and aquatic plants (seaweed and other algae)  
taken for commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence purposes from inland waters, brackish and marine areas, inincluding inshore, 
offshore and high seas marine fishing areas. </P>
<P>
Data include all quantities caught and landed for both food and feed purposes but exclude discards, live escapements or losses prior to landings. 
Catches of fish, crustaceans and molluscs are expressed in live weight, that is the nominal 
weight of the aquatic organisms at the time of capture. The harvest of aquatic plants is given in wet weight.
Data are given in tonnes (=1000 kg), except those for whales, seals and crocodiles, which are given in numbers.</p>
<p>
To assign nationality to catches, the flag of the fishing vessel performing the essential part of the fishing operation is used, unless the 
wording of chartering and joint operation contracts indicates otherwise.</p>
<p>
Fish, crustaceans, molluscs and all other aquatic organisms included in the dataset have been classified according to approximately 3700 commercial species items, further arranged within the 50 groups 
of species constituting the nine divisions of the FAO International Standard Statistical Classification of Aquatic Animals and Plants (ISSCAAP).
The taxonomic code descriptors are taken from the &quot;<a href="https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis" target="_blank">ASFIS list of species for fishery statistics purposes</a>&quot; (version 2024).
Please note that the list of species disseminated in these datasets might not adhere entirely to ASFIS(version 2024) due to differing publication schedules.</p>
<p>
The number of aquatic mammals refers to retained animals reported in the FAO questionnaires in addition to data collected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). 

In the case of IWC, data refer to the total number of aquatic mammals landed (including Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling and landings of directed catches of 
small cetaceans). Since 2023, any retained catches of aquatic mammals from ship strikes and bycatch are not included due to the paucity of information 
available on the fate of these individuals (i.e., whether landed or discarded alive or dead). Consequently, the total number 
of landings of aquatic mammals disseminated in the FAO database are likely to be underestimated.
</p>
<p>
Capture production is also classified according to the inland or marine area where catches took place. These are divided into eight major inland fishing areas and 19 major marine fishing areas, 
internationally established for fishery statistical purposes 
(<a href="https://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/main-water-areas/en/"target="_blank">https://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/main-water-areas/en/</a>).</p>
<p>
The following two additional fishing areas are used exclusively with data derived from databases of the IWC:
<ol>-	Antarctic areas NEI (98)
<br>-	Marine areas outside the Antarctic (99)
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Data aggregated by country, continent, or other major geographical region refer to the quantities caught by the respective country, or countries belonging 
to the continent or region, irrespective of the fishing area where they fished, rather than the amount caught in marine waters surrounding that continent or region. 
</p>

<p>The list of countries and the geographical classification are primarily based on the UN  &quot;STANDARD COUNTRY OR AREA CODES FOR STATISTICAL USE&quot; (<a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/"target="_blank">https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/</a>).
</p>
<p>Additional country classifications available in this Workspace are based on a variety of sources. Here below the main ones:

</ol>
</p>
<p>
Several countries still report their fisheries and aquaculture production by large groups of species. In these circumstances 
the data presented by individual species items may, in some cases, be underestimated. 
Therefore, when examining the statistics for a particular species, it should be noted that an unknown proportion of the production for that species might have been reported by the national office under 
the generic, family or order name of the species, or higher levels of aggregation such as &quot;Marine water fishes NEI&quot; or &quot;Freshwater fishes NEI&quot;. 
Consequently, species item totals may underestimate the real production of the individual species.</p>
<p>
Starting with the release of March 2003, capture production statistics have been extended back to 1950. Data before 1970 in respect to certain species may be subject to further improvements.</p>
<p>Where necessary, any data published in previous releases of this dataset have been revised. Where the figures in the current release differ from those previously published, the amended data 
represent the most recent version. 
Some statistics provided to FAO by national offices, in particular those for the latest year, are provisional and may be amended in future editions.

<p>
The annual period used is the calendar year (1 January-31 December), with the exceptions of capture data in the Antarctic fishing areas (up to 2011) and for some countries for which a split-year is used. 
Starting with the March 2004 release, the new fishing season (1 December-30 November) of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has been adopted. 
Split-year data are shown under the calendar year in which the split-year ends.
