"[space]","Value provided as official when the source agency assigns sufficient confidence that it is not expected to be dramatically revised.","1","Official value","Cifra oficial","Chiffre officiel","A"
"","Observations are characterized as such when different content exists or a different methodology has been applied to this observation as compared with the preceding one (the one given for the previous period).","2","Time series break","Interrupción de la serie cronológica","Rupture dans les séries chronologiques","B"
"","Observation obtained through an estimation methodology or based on the use of a limited amount of data (e.g. to produce a value at an early stage of the production stage while not all data are available). If needed, additional information can be provided through free text using the COMMENT_OBS attribute at the observation level or at a higher level (in SDMX-compliant environment).This code is also to be used when the estimation is done by a sender agency (and flagged as such). When the imputation is carried out by a receiver agency in order to replace or fill gaps in reported data series, the flag to use is I “Value imputed by a receiving agency”.","3","Estimated value","Valor estimado","Valeur estimée","E"
"","Value deemed to assess the magnitude which a quantity will assume at some future point of time (as distinct from ""estimated value"" which attempts to assess the magnitude of an already existent quantity).","4","Forecast value","Valor previsto","Valeur prévue","F"
"","Data collected on the basis of definitions or (alternative) collection methods under development. Data not of guaranteed quality as normally expected from provider.","5","Experimental value","Valor experimental","Valeur expérimentale","G"
"","Observation imputed by a receiving agency to replace or fill gaps in reported data series. This code is intended to cover all cases where a receiving agency publishes data about a sending agency that do not come from an official source in the sender agency's reporting framework. When the estimation is done by the sender agency, the flag to use is E “Estimated value”.","6","Value imputed by a receiving agency","Valor imputado por la agencia receptora","Valeur imputée par l'organisme récepteur","I"
"","Used, for example, when some data are not reported/disseminated because they are below a certain threshold.","7","Missing value; data exist but were not collected","Valor ausente (datos no recopilados)","Valeur manquante (données pas été collectées)","L"
"","Used to denote empty cells resulting from the impossibility to collect a statistical value (e.g. a particular education level or type of institution may be not applicable to a given country's education system).","8","Missing value; data cannot exist","Valor ausente (datos no existen, no aplicable)","Valeur manquante (données pas existent,sans objet)","M"
"","Used to indicate a value which is not a ""real"" zero (e.g. a result of 0.0004 rounded to zero).","9","Not significant (<0.5)","Valor no significativo (<0.5)","Valeur insignifiant (<0.5 )","N"
"...","This code is to be used when the reasons why data are missing cannot be determined.","10","Missing value","Valor ausente","Valeur manquante","O"
"","An observation is characterized as ""provisional"" when the source agency – while it bases its calculations on its standard production methodology – considers that the data, almost certainly, are expected to be revised.","11","Provisional value","Valor provisional","Valeur provisoire","P"
"","Used, for example, when data are suppressed due to statistical confidentiality considerations.","12","Missing value; suppressed","Valor ausente; suprimido","Valeur manquante; supprimée","Q"
"","Special circumstances (e.g. strike) affecting the observation or causing a missing value.","13","Strike and other special events","Huelga y otros eventos especiales","Grève et autres événements spéciaux","S"
"","This indicates existing observations, but for which the user should also be aware of the low quality assigned.","14","Low reliability","Baja confiabilidad","Faible fiabilité","U"
"","Observation as received from the respondent without further evaluation of data quality.","15","Unvalidated value","Valor no validado","Valeur non validée","V"
"","Observation from an international or a supranational organization that does not use any flagging system in data sharing","16","Value from international/mandated organization","Cifra de fuentes internacionales","Ciffre de sources internationales","X"
