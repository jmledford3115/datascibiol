## Description
Several of the variables used in this study are based on results from specialized cardiac tests, including echocardiograms. For more information on interpretation, look [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/heart-disease-prediction-73468d630cfc/).  

## Heart Disease Dataset Variables

### 1. Age  
**Description**: Patient's age in years.  

### 2. Sex  
**Description**: Patient's gender.  

### 3. cp (Chest Pain Type)  
**Description**: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient, categorized as:  
- Typical angina  
- Atypical angina  
- Non-anginal pain  
- Asymptomatic  

### 4. trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure)  
**Description**: Patient’s resting blood pressure measured in mmHg.  

### 5. chol (Serum Cholesterol)  
**Description**: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dL.  

### 6. fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar)  
**Description**: Indicates if fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dL.  

### 7. restecg (Resting Electrocardiogram Results)  
**Description**: Result of the resting electrocardiogram, categorized as:  
- Normal  
- ST-T wave abnormality (e.g., T wave inversions, ST elevation/depression > 0.05 mV).    
- Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy (based on Estes' criteria).  

### 8. thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)  
**Description**: The highest recorded heart rate during the test.  

### 9. exang (Exercise-Induced Angina)  
**Description**: Indicates whether angina is induced by exercise.  

### 10. oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise)  
**Description**: ST depression relative to rest, indicating possible heart stress.  

### 11. slope (Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment)  
**Description**: The slope of the ST segment during peak exercise, categorized as:  
- Upsloping  
- Flat  
- Downsloping  

### 12. ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)  
**Description**: Number of major blood vessels (0–3) visualized via fluoroscopy.  

### 13. thal (Thalassemia Type)  
**Description**: A blood disorder affecting blood flow, categorized as:  
- Unknown  
- Normal blood flow  
- Fixed defect (no blood flow in certain areas of the heart)  
- Reversible defect (abnormal blood flow)  

### 14. target (Heart Disease Indicator)  
**Description**: The predicted outcome; i.e., whether the patient has heart disease.
