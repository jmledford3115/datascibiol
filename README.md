## Welcome!  
This is the course page for **BIS 15L: Introduction to Data Science for Biologists** at UC Davis.  

In BIS 15L, you will be introduced to fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently used by biologists. We will use the R software environment to develop and practice  skills including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Practical examples will use data from a range of disciplines in biology including ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs use a problem-solving approach where we build on previously learned skills culminating in a small, group-based project presented at the end of the quarter. 

This class is designed for students with *no background in computer programming, R, or statistics*. My assumption is that you know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that's it!  

## Class Times  
The class meets twice per week. This quarter, our schedule is:  
+ Mondays, 2:10-4:00p, 2102 SCC  
+ Fridays, 2:10-4:00p, 2102 SCC

## Learning Goals  
*At the end of this course, you will be able to:*  
1. Use R and RStudio to perform basic analyses including arithmetic and basic statistics.  
2. Work with multiple types of data in R and RStudio including vectors, data frames, and nucleotide sequences.  
3. Import and transform complex, messy data for analysis in R using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `purrr`.  
4. Produce a variety of plots and charts to visualize results of data analysis using `ggplot2`.  
5. Build an exploratory analysis pipeline that can be applied to a variety of data types and structures.  
6. Use Shiny to build an interactive application.  
7. Use geospacial data to produce distribution maps. 

## Schedule
We have one lab each week, broken down into multiple parts. Each lab has an associated final report emphasizing the skills learned during the week.  

1. **Lab 1** | [part 1](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab1_1.html) | [part 2](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab1_2.html) | [HW 1](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab1_hw.html)  
2. **Lab 2** | [part 1](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab2_1.html) | [part 2](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab2_2.html) | [HW 2](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/lab2_hw.html)  

## Reading  
There is no required text for the class but, I find [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), Grolemund and Wickham (2017) to be very helpful.    

## Setup Your Computer  
You do not need your own computer during lab, but you will want to have it setup for working on lab reports at home. Here are some easy [setup instructions](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/setup.html) for your personal computer.
