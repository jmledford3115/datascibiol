## Course Summary  
In BIS 015L, you will be introduced to the fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently used by biologists. We will use the R software environment to develop and practice key skills including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Practical examples will span a range of disciplines including social science, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs will use a problem-solving approach where students build on previously learned skills culminating in a small, group-based project presented at the end of the quarter. 

This class is designed for students with *no background in computer programming, R, or statistics*. My assumption is that you know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that's it!  

Please read the [course syllabus](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/logistics/syllabus.html).
