## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Import .csv files as data frames.  
2. Use summary functions to explore the contents of a data frame.  
3. Use the `filter()` function of dplyr to sort data frames.  

## Review
At this point, I expect that you have familiarity in RStudio, GitHub, and basic operations in R. You understand how to do arithmetic, assign values to objects, and work with vectors or data matrices. If you are confused or need some extra help, please [email me](mailto: jmledford@ucdavis.edu).  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

## Data Frames
For the remainder of the course, we will work exclusively with data frames. Recall that data frames store multiple classes of data. Last time, you were shown how to build data frames using the `data.frame()` command. However, scientists often make their data available as supplementary material associated with a publication. As data scientists, we capitalize on this by importing data directly into R.  

## Importing Data
R allows us to import a wide variety of data types. The most common type of file is a .csv file which stands for comma separated values. Spreadsheets are often developed in Excel then saved as .csv files for use in R. There are packages that allow you to open excel files and many other formats directly but .csv is the most common.  

To import any file, first make sure that you are in the correct working directory. If you are not in the correct directory, R will not "see" the file.
```{r}
getwd()
```

## Load Fish Scale Data
Here we open a .csv file with data on fish scales. Since we are using the tidyverse, we open the file using `read_csv()`. `readr` is included in the tidyverse set of packages. We can specify the function and package with the `::` symbol. This becomes important if you have multiple packages loaded which contain functions with the same name. 
```{r}
fish <- readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

## Summary functions
Once data have been uploaded, you may want to get an idea of its contents and dimensions. This may seem self-evident for small files but this is a big help for large data files.
```{r}
nrow(fish) #the number of rows
```

```{r}
ncol(fish) #the number of columns
```

```{r}
dim(fish) #total dimensions
```

```{r}
names(fish) #column names
```

There are many other useful summary functions, all of which work a bit differently. I didn't try to make the joke about fish heads and tails on purpose, but here it is anyway.
```{r}
head(fish, n = 10) # print the first n rows of the data frame
```

```{r}
tail(fish, n = 10) # print the last n rows of the data frame
```

We can also click on the `fish` data frame in the Environment tab or type View(fish).
```{r}
View(fish)
```

`summary()` and `str()` are classic functions used by many R programmers. `glimpse()` is part of the tidyverse.
```{r}
summary(fish)
```

```{r}
str(fish)
```

```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```

## Practice
Load the data `mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv` and place it into a new object called `mammals`.
```{r}
mammals <- readr::read_csv("data/Mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv")
```

1. Provide the dimensions of the data frame.
```{r}
dim(mammals)
```

2. Check the column names in the data frame. 
```{r}
names(mammals)
```

3. Use `str()` to show the structure of the data frame and its individual columns; compare this to `glimpse()`. 
```{r}
str(mammals)
```

```{r}
glimpse(mammals)
```

4. Print out the first few rows of the data using the function `head()`.  
```{r}
head(mammals)
```

5. Print out the last few rows using the function `tail()`.
```{r}
tail(mammals)
```

## Tidyverse
The [tidyverse](www.tidyverse.org) is a collection of packages that make workflows in R easier. The packages operate more intuitively than base R commands. Although not universal, the tidyverse has been adopted by many R users.

## dplyr: filter()
A core package in the tidyverse is dplyr. This package allows you to transform your data in many different ways including filtering, subsetting, and reordering. Dplyr allows you to parse out data of interest from a larger data frame.  

The first command that we will learn is `filter()`. Filter allows you to subset observations in a data frame by their values. You should still have the fish data loaded, but if not then please re-load.  
```{r}
fish <- 
  readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

Let's say that we are interested only in the fish that occur in the lake labeled AL. We can use `filter()` to extract these observations to build a new data frame focused on our question.
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "AL")
```

Similarly, if we are only interested in fish with a length greater than or equal to 350 we can use `filter()` to do this work.
```{r}
filter(fish, length >= 350)
```

Filtering allows all of the expected operators; i.e. >, >=, <, <=, != (not equal), and == (equal).  It also allows us to extract multiple values simultaneously.
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "AL" & length > 350) #only the fish that have lakeid AL AND length >350
```













## That's it, let's take a break!
