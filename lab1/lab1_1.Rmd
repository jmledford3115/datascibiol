In nearly every field of science, our ability to generate data has exceeded our capacity for analysis. For me, this means that there is the potential for loss to science; many important discoveries may go unnoticed because we are unable to efficiently analyze data. AI is helping a lot with this, but there is still a need for people who can manage, transform, and visualize data. This course is designed to give you the tools you need to do this using the R programming language.  

The goal for this course is to help get you started using the R programming language. You will learn to clearly and neatly organize messy data, transform it in ways that address your questions, and communicate results in a variety of formats. The course is designed for people with **no prior programming experience**. There is a substantial learning curve but, working together, we will make learning R easier, interesting, and fun.  

This class is NOT focused on statistical analysis, interpretation, or modeling. The goal is to provide you with the foundational skills you need to perform these tasks.   

**What about AI?** Will programming become an irrelevant skill? AI is a powerful tool, but it is just that. To use it effectively, you need to understand the data you are working with and the questions you are trying to answer. Programming skills can help you use AI more effectively.  

## First steps  
The first two weeks of the class can seem slow, tedious, and frustrating. These first steps are like learning a new language; you often won't know what is being said or why. Please be patient- I promise that it will get easier.  

## Resources  
Given that R is open source, many resources are available online. We will use a combination of resources in the class, but key items are listed below.  

- [Class GitHub Website](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/)  
- [R for data science, 2e](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- [R cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

## UC Davis  
Our campus has a wealth of expertise in data science. There is even a [major](https://www.ucdavis.edu/majors/data-science) in data science. Should your interests progress, here are some links. The Davis R Users Group offers regular workshops. Among the goals of this class is to get you set-up so that you can attend and learn more!

## Help!  
When you need help with homework or a class topic, please post on the class Canvas site. We are here to support you and everyone should participate, please.  

## Lab 1 Goals  
The goal of lab 1 is to get everyone started using R, RStudio, and GitHub. All of our work will be done in RStudio and uploaded to the class GitHub repository. It is important that everyone is set-up correctly before we are done today. In the spirit of the R universe, our class is a community. If you see someone struggling, please give them some help.  

## Lab Computers  
This quarter we are fortunate to be able to use the computers in the SCC. Each of these computers is up-to-date, and the installed software is exactly the same. This makes following my instructions much easier, but you will likely want to have the ability to work at home. Please follow the directions below to set-up your personal computer.  

## Setup your computer  
Because you will need to work on assignments at home, it is important that you spend time making sure that your computer is set-up and ready to go. The first step in this is basic maintenance; i.e. clean up your desktop and update your OS. Data scientists are neat and tidy! Spend time getting yourself organized, it will pay off.  

Please follow these steps to set-up you computer [here](https://jmledford3115.github.io/datascibiol/logistics/setup.html).  

## Computer Hygiene  
Keeping your computer happy and healthy takes some work. Here are some steps that you can take to make sure that your computer is running optimally.  

1. Make sure all of the latest updates are installed for your OS.  
2. Organize your desktop.  
3. Close all open tabs on your browser.  
4. Completely shut down and restart your computer.  
5. Wipe down the keyboard and clean your screen.  
6. Commit to keeping your computer happy and healthy this quarter. 

## Canvas
I have setup Canvas to mirror the class webpage. Both sites contain the same information except for grades. Most people will be fine using the Canvas site and it is more accessible. Please make sure that you pay attention to class announcements- these will all come from Canvas.  

## R vs. RStudio  
R is the programming language that we will use in this class. RStudio is an interface (Integrated Development Environment, IDE) that makes using R easier. It's a graphical interface that allows you to write and run code, visualize data, and manage files. RStudio is not required to use R, but it makes the experience much more user-friendly.  

## RStudio Layout  
When you open RStudio, you will see that the window is divided into four sections. Each of these sections has a specific function that we will use throughout the course.  

1. **Source (Top Left)**: This is where you write and edit R scripts and RMarkdown files.  
2. **Console (Bottom Left)**: This is where R executes your commands.   
3. **Environment (Top Right)**: The Environment tab shows all the objects (like data frames, vectors, etc.) that you have created during your R session.  
4. **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (Bottom Right)**: This section has multiple tabs. The Files tab allows you to navigate your file system. The Plots tab displays any graphs you create. The Packages tab lets you manage R packages. The Help tab provides access to R documentation, and the Viewer tab is used for viewing local web content.
