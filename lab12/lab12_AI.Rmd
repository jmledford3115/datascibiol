## AI and R
1. Two popular AI tools used in programming are GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.  
2. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool developed by GitHub (and OpenAI). It integrates into development environments (including RStudio and other IDEs) and provides inline code suggestions as you write.  
3. ChatGPT (OpenAI) is a conversational AI system that can assist with coding, data analysis, debugging, explanation, and interpretation, depending on the model version being used.  

## Basics
1. Machine Learning is a broad category of AI that involves training algorithms on data to make predictions.  
2. Generative AI refers to AI models that can generate new content (text, code, images, etc.) based on patterns learned from training data.  
3. LLM's (Large Language Models) are a type of generative AI that can understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training data.  

## Discussion
1. What AI tools have you used (ChatGPT, Copilot, Grammarly, image generators, etc.)?
2. In what contexts have you used them (school, work, personal projects)?
3. What worked well? What did not?
4. What does “generative” mean in the context of AI? Does AI “understand” code, or does it predict patterns? 
5. Is using AI to write code the same as plagiarism? Who owns AI work?
6. How should AI use be acknowledged in academic work?
7. What are the risks of relying on AI without understanding the code? 
8. Why might AI-generated code look different from beginner-written code? 
9. Do you think your professors use AI? Would you want instructors to disclose AI use in course materials?
10. Will AI reduce the need to learn syntax? What skills will become more important in an AI-assisted world?  

## My Thoughts
1. AI is revolutionary, I am not 100% sure where it is going.  
2. The rate at which AI is improving is very, very fast.  
3. Prompting and interaction with AI is a skill that will be increasingly important.  
4. You need a foundation in coding to use AI effectively.  
5. You **must** think critically.  
6. Data, privacy, ownership, and responsibility have not been responsibly addressed.  
7. Last year, the big AI companies spent $400B on data centers. What is their plan for ROI?
8. Nothing on the internet is free.
