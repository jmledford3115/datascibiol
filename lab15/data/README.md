# Data from: The evolution of gestation length in eutherian mammals

Overview

This repository contains data, code, and supplemental materials associated with our study on mammalian trait evolution.

all_mammals.newick: Phylogenetic tree of all mammalian species in Newick format.
residuals.csv: CSV file containing residual values from statistical analyses.
Data_S1.csv: Primary data file used for analysis, including species traits and ecological variables.

Key Variables of Data_S1:
Body Mass: The body mass of each mammalian species, measured in grams (g)
Longevity: The expected lifespan of each species, measured in years.
Gestation Length: The length of pregnancy for each species, measured in days
