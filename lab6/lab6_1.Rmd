## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Use `distinct()` to find unique observations in rows.    
2. Use `mutate()` to create new columns from existing columns.    
3. Use `mutate()` with `across` and `where` to transform multiple columns that meet specific criteria.
4. Use `if_else()` to conditionally change values in a column.
5. Clean data using `janitor` and `mutate()`.  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
library("palmerpenguins") #load the palmerpenguins package
options(scipen=999) #turn off scientific notation
```

## Palmerpenguins
These data are from: Gorman KB, Williams TD, Fraser WR (2014). Ecological sexual dimorphism and environmental variability within a community of Antarctic penguins (genus _Pygoscelis_). PLoS ONE 9(3):e90081. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081

## Review & Practice
Recall that the the verbs `select()` and `filter()` are used to extract columns and rows from a dataframe. We use the pipe operator `%>%` to connect multiple functions together.  

1. Select species, island, and body mass from the penguins data. Arrange results by body mass.
```{r}

```

2. Filter the penguins data to only include observations from Biscoe and Dream islands.
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

3. Make a plot that shows the relationship between body mass and flipper length. How does this compare among different species?
```{r}

```

## `distinct()`
`distinct()` looks for all unique observations in rows. This is a little tricky because it can look like it is working column-wise, but it is actually working row-wise.  

One helpful approach to new data is to find any duplicated rows. If we first look at the dimensions of the penguins data, we see it has 344 rows and 8 columns.
```{r}

```

Using `distinct()` across all rows, we see there are no duplicates. This means every row contains unique observations across all variables.
```{r}

```

But if we only look at species, we can see that there are only 3 unique species in the data.
```{r}

```

What if we want to know which islands each species occurs on?
```{r}

```

## `mutate()`
`mutate()` is another verb that acts on columns. It allows us to create new columns from existing columns in a data frame. When we use `mutate()`, the columns are added to the end of the dataframe by default. Let's create a new column that converts body mass from grams to kilograms.
```{r}

```

## `mutate()` and `across()`
We use `across()` within `mutate()` to apply a function to multiple columns. This is especially helpful when cleaning data. For example, let's say we want to convert all columns that end with `mm` to centimeters. We can use `across()` to do this.
```{r}

```

What does the `~./10` mean? The `~` indicates that what follows is a formula (lambda function). The `.` represents the current column being processed. So, `./10` means "take the current column and divide it by 10". This operation is applied to all columns that end with `mm`.

## Cleaning Data
Cleaning raw data is an essential, but tedious step in data analysis. It's impossible to predict every scenario that you will come across, but there are some common issues that we can learn to address.

We already learned how to use `rename()` to change column names. We also learned how to rename columns from within `select()`. But, this can be very inefficient if we have a large dataset.

Let's have a look at some new data focused on mammal lifehistories. The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.   [link](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/)  
```{r}

```

What is the structure of the data? Are there any NA's or other issues?
```{r}

```

One thing to notice is the column names are inconsistent. This is going to cause problems for us down the line. We could rename each column, one at a time, using `rename()`, but that would be tedious. Instead, we can use the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package to fix all of the column names at once.
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Notice that `clean_names()` has converted all column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores. But, no adjustments were made to the data itself. What if we want to change observations from upper case to lower case?
```{r}

```

This will change all columns to lower case. But, notice what happens to numeric columns.
```{r}

```

For this reason, it might be better to use `where` so we can specify only character columns.
```{r}

```

## `if_else()`
We briefly introduce `if_else()` here because it allows us to use `mutate()` but not have the entire column affected in the same way. With `ifelse()`, you first specify a logical statement, afterwards what needs to happen if the statement returns `TRUE`, and lastly what needs to happen if it's  `FALSE`.  

Have a look at the data from mammals below. Notice that the values for newborn include `-999.00`. This is sometimes used as a placeholder for NA (but, is a really bad idea). We can use `if_else()` to replace `-999.00` with `NA`.  
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

## Practice
1. Following the example above, convert all -999 values in the mammals dataframe to NA.
```{r}

```

```{r}

```

2. In the mammals data, make a new column `mass_kg` that that converts mass from grams to kilograms. Select the columns genus, species, mass, and mass_kg, and arrange the data by mass_kg in descending order. What is the common name for the species with the highest mass?  
```{r}

```

3. What is the relationship between gestation and newborn mass?
```{r}

```

4. Which mammal has the longest life span in years?  
```{r}

```

5. Do larger mammals live longer?
```{r}

```
