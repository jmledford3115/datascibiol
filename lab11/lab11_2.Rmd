## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Build stacked bar plots of categorical variables.  
2. Build side-by-side barplots using `position= "dodge"`.  
3. Build histograms and density plots.  
4. Create new categories with `case_when()`.

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
options(scipen=999) #cancels the use of scientific notation for the session
```

## Data
**Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**

Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  
```{r}
homerange <- 
  read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv", na = c("", "NA", "\\"))
```

## A few more useful aesthetics
There are many options to create nice plots in ggplot. One useful trick is to store the plot as a new object and then experiment with geom's and aesthetics. Let's setup a plot that compares `log10.mass` and `log10.hra.` Notice that we are not specifying a geom.
```{r}
p <- homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= log10.mass, y= log10.hra))
```

Play with point size by adjusting the `size` argument.
```{r}
p + geom_point(size=1.25)
```

We can color the points by a categorical variable.
```{r}
p+geom_point(aes(color=thermoregulation), size=1.5)
```

We can also map shapes to another categorical variable.
```{r}
p+geom_point(aes(shape=thermoregulation, color=thermoregulation), size=1.5) # we use color here and not fill because we are not filling a shape
```
What about just filling in with a color preference or size?
```{r}
p+geom_point(size=5, color="red", alpha=0.8, shape=21, fill="blue") #alpha is transparency
```

```{r}
colors()
```

```{r}
# Plot all available point shapes
df <- data.frame(x = 1:25, y = rep(1, 25), shape = 0:24)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = factor(shape)), size = 5, fill = "lightblue") +
  scale_shape_manual(values = 0:24) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), vjust = -1, size = 5)
```

## Barplots and multiple variables
At this point you should be comfortable building bar plots that show counts of observations using `geom_bar()`. Last time we explored the `fill` option as a way to bring color to the plot; i.e. we filled by the same variable that we were plotting. What happens when we fill by a different categorical variable?  
Let's start by counting how many observations we have in each taxonomic group.
```{r}
homerange %>% count(taxon, sort=T)
```

Now let's make a bar plot of these data.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = "Taxonomic Group")
```

By specifying `fill=trophic.guild` we build a stacked bar plot that shows the proportion of a given taxonomic group that is an herbivore or carnivore.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon, fill = trophic.guild)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = "Taxonomic Group",
       fill = "Trophic Guild") #fill is the legend title
```

We can also have counts of each trophic guild within taxonomic group shown side-by-side by specifying `position="dodge"`.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon, fill = trophic.guild)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = "Taxonomic Group",
       fill = "Trophic Guild") +
  coord_flip()
```

Here is the same plot oriented vertically.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon, fill = trophic.guild)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + #angle is the angle of the text
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = "Taxonomic Group",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

We can also scale all bars to a percentage.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon, fill = trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(position = position_fill())+ 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  coord_flip()
```

## Practice
For this practice, let's use the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data.  

1. Make a bar plot that shows counts of individuals by island. Fill by species, and try both a stacked bar plot and `position="dodge"`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, fill = species)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x = "Island",
       fill = "Species")
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, fill = species)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  labs(title = "Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x = "Island",
       fill = "Species")
```

2. Make another bar plot that shows the number of individuals by sex on each island?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  labs(title = "Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x = "Island",
       fill = "Species")
```

## Using `group`
In addition to `fill`, `group` is an aesthetic that accomplishes the same function but does not add color. It groups data for plotting.

Here is a box plot that shows `log10.mass` by taxonomic `class.`
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

I use `group` to make individual box plots for each taxon.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass, group = taxon)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

I can also use `fill` to associate the different taxa with a color coded key.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass, fill = taxon)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
