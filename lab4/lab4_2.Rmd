## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Explain the difference between tidy and messy data.  
2. Evaluate a dataset as tidy or untidy.  
3. Use the `pivot_wider()` function of tidyr to transform data from long to wide format.  
4. Use `summarize()` and `group_by()` to produce statistical summaries of data.

## Group Project
Let's take 10 minutes to decide on groups and think about a theme for our projects. What data interest you? Make a plan on doing some internet searches and selecting data that will work for your group. Think about the kinds of questions you might ask.  

## Resources
- [tidyr `pivot_wider()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html)  
- [pivoting](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/pivot.html)  

## Review
Last time we learned the fundamentals of tidy data and used the `pivot_longer()` function to wrangle a few types of frequently encountered untidy data. In the second part of today's lab we will use the `pivot_wider()` function to deal with a second type of untidy data.  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

## `pivot_longer()`
Recall that we use `pivot_longer()` when our column names actually represent variables. A classic example would be that the column names represent observations of a variable.
```{r}
datasets::USPersonalExpenditure
?USPersonalExpenditure
```

Here we add a new column of expenditure types, which are stored as rownames above, with `mutate()`. The USPersonalExpenditures data also needs to be converted to a data frame before we can use the tidyverse functions, because it comes as a matrix.
```{r}
expenditures <- 
  USPersonalExpenditure %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(expenditure = rownames(USPersonalExpenditure))
expenditures
```

## Practice
1. Are these data tidy? Please use `pivot_longer()` to tidy the data. Here we use back ticks on the column names so R does not confuse them with numerical indices.
```{r}
expenditures_tidy <- 
  expenditures %>% 
  pivot_longer(-expenditure,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "bn_dollars")
expenditures_tidy
```

2. Restrict the data to medical and health expenditures only. Sort in ascending order.
```{r}
expenditures_tidy %>%
  filter(expenditure == "Medical and Health") %>% 
  arrange(bn_dollars)
```

## `pivot_wider()`
The opposite of `pivot_longer()`. You use `pivot_wider()` when you have an observation scattered across multiple rows. In the example below, `cases` and `population` represent variable names not observations.  

Rules:  
+ `pivot_wider`(names_from, values_from)  
+ `names_from` - Values in the `names_from` column will become new column names  
+ `values_from` - Cell values will be taken from the `values_from` column  

```{r}
tb_data <- read_csv("data/tb_data.csv")
tb_data
```

When using `pivot_wider()` we use `names_from` to identify the variables (new column names) and `values_from` to identify the values associated with the new columns.
```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "key", #the observations under key will become new columns
              values_from = "value")
```

## Practice
1. Load the `gene_exp.csv` data as a new object `gene_exp`. Are these data tidy? Use `pivot_wider()` to tidy the data.
```{r}
gene_exp <- readr::read_csv("data/gene_exp.csv")
gene_exp
```

```{r}
gene_exp %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type",
              values_from = "L4_values")
```

## `pivot_wider()` with multiple variables  
What happens when we want to use `pivot_wider()` with multiple columns?
```{r}
edu_level <- readr::read_csv("data/education_level.csv")
```

We want to pivot the `edu_level` data such that there is only a single row per demographic. 
```{r}
edu_level %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from = (education_level), #new column names come from the education_level column
                values_from = c(mean_income, n)) #values come from two separate columns
```

## `rename()`
The `rename()` function is actually part of *dplyr*, but I put it here because I think of it as part of transforming untidy data. Remember, youcan still rename columns as part of `select()`.
```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "key",
              values_from = "value") %>% 
  dplyr::rename(
    Country=country,
    Year=year,
    New_Cases=cases,
    Population=population
  )
```

## `summarize()`
`summarize()` will produce summary statistics for a given variable in a data frame. For example, in homework 2 you were asked to calculate the mean of the sleep total column for large and small mammals. We did this using a combination of tidyverse and base R commands, which isn't very efficient or clean. We can do better!  
```{r}
msleep
```

From homework 2.
```{r}
large <- 
  msleep %>% 
  select(name, genus, bodywt, sleep_total) %>% 
  filter(bodywt >= 200) %>% 
  arrange(desc(bodywt))
large
```

```{r}
mean(large$sleep_total)
```

We can accomplish the same task using the `summarize()` function in the tidyverse and make things cleaner.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt >= 200) %>%
  summarize(mean_sleep_lg = mean(sleep_total))
```

You can also combine functions to make useful summaries for multiple variables.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
    filter(bodywt >= 200) %>% 
    summarize(mean_sleep_lg = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep_lg = min(sleep_total),
              max_sleep_lg = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```

`n_distinct()` is a very handy way of cleanly presenting the number of distinct observations. Here we show the number of distinct genera over 200 in body weight.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(bodywt >= 200) %>% 
  summarise(n_genera=n_distinct(genus))
```

There are many other useful summary statistics, depending on your needs: sd(), min(), max(), median(), sum(), n() (returns the length of vector), first() (returns first value in vector), last() (returns last value in vector) and n_distinct() (number of distinct values in vector).

## Practice
1. How many genera are represented in the msleep data frame?
```{r}
msleep %>%
  summarize(ngenera = n_distinct(genus))
```

2. What are the min, max, and mean body weight for all of the mammals? Be sure to include the total n.
```{r}
msleep %>%
  summarize(min_bodywt = min(bodywt),
            max_bodywt = max(bodywt),
            mean_bodywt = mean(bodywt),
            total = n())
```

## `group_by()`
The `summarize()` function is most useful when used in conjunction with `group_by()`. Although producing a summary of body weight for all of the mammals in the dataset is helpful, what if we were interested in body weight by feeding ecology?
```{r}
names(msleep)
```

```{r}
msleep %>%
  group_by(vore) %>% #we are grouping by feeding ecology
  summarize(min_bodywt = min(bodywt),
            max_bodywt = max(bodywt),
            mean_bodywt = mean(bodywt),
            total=n())
```

`count()` is an easy way of determining how many observations you have within a column. It effectively acts like a combination of `group_by()` and `n()`.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  count(order, sort = T)
```

You can also use `count()` across multiple variables.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  count(order, vore, sort = TRUE)
```

`add_count()` adds a new column to the dataframe.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  select(name:order) %>% 
  add_count(order) %>% 
  top_n(-5) #the bottom 5 
```

## Practice
1. Calculate mean brain weight by taxonomic order in the msleep data.
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_brainwt = mean(brainwt))
```

2. What does `NA` mean?  

_In this case it means we are actually missing data because the brain weight for some animals has not been measured._  

3. Try running the code again, but this time add `na.rm=TRUE`. What is the problem with Cetacea?  
```{r}
msleep %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_brainwt = mean(brainwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  filter(order == "Cetacea")
```

## That's it, let's take a break!
